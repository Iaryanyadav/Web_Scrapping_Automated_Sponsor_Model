Later, ICC found Tendulkar not guilty of tampering. ICC spokesperson Mark Harrison said that Tendulkar was cleaning the ball without the umpire's permission rather than ball tampering. He said,\\\"It's still an offence but it's not as serious as ball tampering.\\\"[9]The Guardian\\u2022Critisims for low attendance in parliament:During his term as the Rajya Sabha Member, he was often criticized for being absent in the Parliament sittings and not raising any questions in the house.[10]ZEE News\\u2022Name appeared in Pandora Papers leak:Sachin Tendulkar's name appeared in the Pandora Papers leak on 3 October 2021, which was exposed by a worldwide journalistic partnership, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). It claimed to have uncovered the financial details of many celebrities in 91 countries, including India. The ICIJ reported that secret documents linked offshore assets to many celebrities including cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, pop music divaShakira, supermodel Claudia Schiffer, and an Italian mobster called \\\"Lell the Fat One.\\\" The attorney for Tendulkar, however, claimed that Tendulkar had already informed the authorities about his investments.[11]The Hindu\\u2022Casino used his morphed images for promotion:On 24 February 2022, Sachin Tendulkar took to Twitter to say that he would initiate legal action against a casino that used his morphed image for promotion. Reportedly, a Goa-based casino named 'Big Daddy' had used his morphed image for its promotion on social media.[12]NDTV\\u2022Promoting Paytm First Games:Sachin Tendulkar faced criticism from his fans after appearing in an advertisement endorsing an online gaming app, Paytm First Games. Many of his followers expressed their disappointment over his association with such an app. On 31 August 2023, a protest was organized by several politicians, including Bachchu Kadu, outside Sachin Tendulkar's residence in Bandra, Mumbai. Kadu talked about the matter in an interview and voiced his concerns that Sachin Tendulkar's endorsement of a gambling app like Paytm First Games might raise questions about his suitability as a recipient of the Bharat Ratna award.[13]The TribuneBachchu Kadu said,Those who have been awarded Bharat Ratna have to follow a code of conduct. We will send a notice to Sachin Tendulkar on the 30th of August 2023. We had given him time till the 30th. Till now, he has not clarified any of his positions in this regard. So, we are going to send him a notice through a lawyer. Sachin Tendulkar is Bharat Ratna. It is not right for a person who has numerous fans and Bharat Ratna to advertise a gambling app like Paytm First.
